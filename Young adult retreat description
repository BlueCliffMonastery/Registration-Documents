Come celebrate awakened living with other young people at Blue Cliff Monastery in upstate New York, a mindfulness practice center in the tradition of Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh.

In today’s hectic world, we all experience the stress, pressures, and expectations of daily life – mindless consumption, overwork, anxiety about the future, and the search for meaning.

How can we touch peace and freedom in the midst of all this?

At this retreat, we will:

* Learn how to stop and listen more deeply to ourselves and others
* Explore what binds us, and what can make us more free
* Share about relationships (self-identity, communication, true love)
* Learn tools for handling strong emotions such as fear, anger, anxiety and despair
* Share our deeper aspirations and direction in life
* Practice sitting and walking meditation
* Share mindful meals
* Enjoy deep relaxation sessions
* Listen to Dharma talks
* Engage in forest walks, circle sharing, mindful movement, and creative expression – bring your musical instruments!
* Enjoy quiet and reflection

This retreat is open for both new and experienced mindfulness practitioners. Recommended ages 18-35.
